# _PyRPG Framework_

## Outline

PyRPG is a small project managed by myself with one simple goal, create a simple and intuitive framework for createing RPG style games in python. With that goal in mind I've created a list of objectives that are meant to keep the development on track and in the end create a focused framework. If you are interested in contributing to the development of this then feel free to pull the repository and add to it. Ultimately this should be simple and user friendly.
